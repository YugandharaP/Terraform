ssh into instance created through terraform , need pem/ppk file

#problem statement
  I have only one pem file and i want to create multiple instance using this same pem file
  
  
#--Solution
You need to copy public key and paste it in this resource or paste it in some file and give path of that file

resource "aws_key_pair" "terraform-common-key"{
	key_name 	= "${var.key_name}"
	public_key 	= "${file("authorized_keys")}"
}
